# Project Title: Enhancing POS Terminal Repair Rates through Strategic Workforce Planning

## Overview:
This project aims to optimize operational performance in POS (Point of Sale) terminal repair services through data-driven analysis and strategic workforce planning. By leveraging Excel and Power BI, we conducted an in-depth examination of various factors influencing repair rates and work efficiency, with a focus on the impact of workdays and engineering team size.

## Key Findings:
1. **Workdays vs. Repair Rates:** Our analysis revealed that increasing workdays did not lead to improvements in POS terminal repair rates or work efficiency. This suggests that extending work hours may not be the most effective strategy for enhancing service delivery.
   
2. **Engineering Team Size vs. Repair Rates:** In contrast, augmenting the number of engineers per region significantly enhanced repair rates, indicating that a larger engineering team positively impacts operational performance, particularly a key performance indicator like repair rates.

3. **Unchanged Work Rate:** Despite the increase in engineers, the overall work rate remained unchanged. This implies that factors other than staff numbers influence work efficiency, highlighting the need for a multifaceted approach to improve operational performance.

## Implications for Strategic Workforce Planning:
These findings underscore the importance of strategic workforce planning in optimizing operational performance. Instead of solely focusing on extending work hours, investing in expanding the engineering team can yield more significant improvements in repair rates. However, it's crucial to recognize that workforce optimization involves addressing various factors beyond staffing levels.

## Recommendations:
1. **Invest in Engineering Team Expansion:** Allocate resources towards increasing the number of engineers per region to enhance repair rates and overall service delivery.
   
2. **Explore Work Efficiency Factors:** Further investigate the factors influencing work efficiency to identify areas for improvement beyond staff numbers.
   
3. **Continuous Monitoring and Adaptation:** Implement a system for ongoing monitoring of repair rates and work efficiency, coupled with adaptive workforce planning strategies to respond to changing operational dynamics.
