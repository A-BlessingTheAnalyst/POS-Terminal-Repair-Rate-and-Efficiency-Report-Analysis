## Overview

This project aims to optimize operational performance in POS (Point of Sale) terminal repair services through data-driven analysis and strategic workforce planning. Utilizing Excel and Power BI, we conducted an in-depth examination of factors such as workdays and engineering team size to understand their impact on repair rates and work efficiency.

## Tools Used

- **Microsoft Excel**: Used for data preprocessing, analysis, and initial visualization.
- **Power BI**: Employed for creating in-depth visualizations, interactive dashboards, and data-driven storytelling.


## Key Findings

- Increased workdays did not improve POS terminal repair rates or work efficiency, suggesting that extending work hours is not effective for enhancing service delivery.
- Expanding the number of engineers per region significantly improved repair rates, showing that a larger engineering team positively impacts operational performance.
- Despite more engineers, the overall work rate remained unchanged, indicating that other factors also influence work efficiency and should be addressed.

## Implications for Strategic Workforce Planning

These findings highlight the importance of strategic workforce planning. Rather than extending work hours, investing in engineering team expansion can yield better improvements in repair rates. Operational performance optimization requires a comprehensive approach that addresses multiple factors.

## Recommendations

- Increase the number of engineers per region to enhance repair rates and overall service delivery.
- Investigate other factors affecting work efficiency to identify improvement areas beyond staffing levels.
- Implement ongoing monitoring of repair rates and work efficiency, adapting workforce planning strategies as needed.
